## Project Synopsis

### Problem Statement
Ethiopian startups lack visibility, official recognition, and access to government support provided under the new Startup Law. There’s no centralized digital system for identifying real startups or connecting them with government programs or diaspora support. As a result, trust is low and growth is slow.

### Planned Solution
We will build a web platform where:
- Startups register and verify team identity using Fayda Digital ID.
- Verified startups submit applications to be officially recognized under the startup law.
- Approved startups get listed publicly as “Verified Ethiopian Startups.”
- Diaspora, investors, and organizations can browse startups, offer investment, mentorship, or collaboration.

### Expected Outcome
- Trusted, visible ecosystem of verified Ethiopian startups.
- A centralized, government-aligned database.
- Simplified access to legal and financial benefits for startups.
- Improved investment confindece and mentorship from diaspora and local partners.
- Reduced fraud and duplication via digital ID-based validation.

### Fayda's Role
Fayda will be used to:
- Verify startup founders' identities during registration.
- Build trust in the authenticity of submitted startups.
- Prevent fraud and duplication.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: **Next.js** — Web framework
- Authentication: VeriFayda OIDC integration
- Database: MongoDB
- Deployment: Railway or Vercel (TBD)
- Version Control: GitHub
