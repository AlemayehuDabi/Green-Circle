## Project Synopsis

### Problem Statement (What problem are we solving?)
Ethiopian startup founders often face challenges in getting officially recognized and accessing government benefits like tax breaks, grants, and legal support. The current processes are manual, prone to fraud, and lack a centralized digital system. Additionally, investors have limited access to verified startup data, increasing risk.

### Planned Solution (How do we plan to solve it?)
FaydaStartup is a secure web platform that leverages the **Fayda digital ID** to verify all users — startup founders, investors, and government reviewers — and streamline the startup registration process. Founders can register their startups digitally, and government agencies can review and approve them via an admin panel. Once approved, startups gain access to official benefits, and investors can explore a directory of verified startups.

### Expected Outcome (What do we hope to achieve?)
- Digitally verified and registered startups linked to real founder identities.
- Verified government and investor users interacting securely.
- Simplified and transparent application and approval workflows.
- Increased government efficiency and reduced fraud.
- Improved investor trust and reduced risk in startup funding.
- A centralized ecosystem for startups, government, and investors to interact securely.

### Fayda's Role (How does Fayda fit into our project?)
Fayda plays a **central role in identity verification** across the platform:
- **Verifying all users** — startup founders, investors, and government officials — through secure digital ID login.
- Enabling **trust and transparency** in the ecosystem by tying all actions to **real, verified identities**.
- Supporting Ethiopia’s **startup law** by ensuring that all beneficiaries are authenticated.
- Reducing fraud, fake applications, and untrustworthy investment activity.

## Tech Stack we plan to use

### Front to Back
- **Next.js** – framework for building the interactive dashboards and backend logic

### Authentication & Integration
- **Fayda Digital ID** – Identity verification for all users
- **OAuth2 / National ID API Integration** – For Fayda login
